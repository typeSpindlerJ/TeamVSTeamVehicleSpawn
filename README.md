# Team VS Team Vehicle Spawn ( PHASE 1 )
>Initially will be created as a single player script then will port to multi player:

- Establish an area on Stratis Air Base for the "playing area" approx 650 x 650m

- Total game will be on a 15 min total timer 

- Develop scripts for when leaving the area a count down is shown and will result in death if they donâ€™t return to playing area

- Spawn 1 vehicle for each side that will be a mobile spawn point moving forward

- Players will initially spawn inside the vehicle, respawns will be within 5m of vehicle

- Vehicle after a 5 min period will be a full Arsenal

- Vehicle will maintain stock armor and driving for Phase 1

- Once vehicle is destroyed there will be no respawn ( I know just for documentation )

- Team with the most amount of kills (after 15 mins)  or last team standing wins
